# The javax.* package has been renamed to jakarta.* package since Jakarta EE version 9. This thus means that the deployed web application is actually not compatible with Jakarta EE version 9. The deployed web application is most likely developed for an older JEE version where the javax.* package is still used.
# Downgrade Tomcat to version 9.x. This is the latest available version which still uses the javax.* package.
